# Fatherruner

Fatherrunner - is open-source Telegram bot that provides Tekken 8 frame data.
Bot is built using python and aiogram.
[Try it out](t.me/fatherrunner_bot)

How to:
- Type **!fd 'character' 'move'** - to get frame data for your move and character.
- Type **!help (or /start)** to get help on the bots usage.
- Type **!feedback** and provide your message to send your feedback.
- Type **characters** to get full list of character names.

To do list:
- ~~Implement better input filtering.~~ *Done!*
- Implement 'Punish' feature.
- Implement anti-string feature.
- ~~Implement receiving frame data 'on-fly'.~~ *Too inefficient.*
- Blacklist (?)

All the data is primarily from tekkendocs.com <3
